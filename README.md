# Synthetic Data Gen
 Synthetic Data Gen(SDG) is a group of python scripts that uses Blender<link> to generate various images using 3d models and images. With the goal to generate images of objects that there's no enough data available to train vision models. The code has implemented anti biasing techniques like random positioning and different light conditions.
 This project is still on its initial stages, a lot of work is still to be done and there's a lot of room to improvement.
